Our neural network model will predict historical stock market trends for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ. Using this existing model we will adapt it to fit the needs of continuous training, anomaly detection, protection against adversarial attacks, as well as explainability of model predictions in the use case of orbital data.
